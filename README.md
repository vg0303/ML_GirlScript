# ML_GirlScript

This repository is for the Education Outreach program by GirlScript Foundation.
Through this program I am exploring Machine Learning and my mentor Ms. Shivani Shimpi is helping in the process.
I have used Google Colab for coding part and TenserFlow and Keras for building the ML model.

By clicking on the "open in colab" button you can view the code in Google Colab.
I have added comments and text while writing the code for better understanding.
